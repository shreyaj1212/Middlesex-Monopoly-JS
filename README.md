# Middlesex-Monopoly-Shreya-JS
 
The official version of this project is in the Middlesex School Programming Club Group on GitHub. All of the code in that version is in PHP, but I want to give it a try in JavaScript, so I've made a new repository so as not to interrupt the rest of the group's progress.
